# Prime Number App

### Assignment Description
This assignment has 2 parts.  
1) Write a client/server application with two parts, a server and a client. Have the client send the server a request to compute whether a number that the user provided is prime. The server responds with yes or no, then the client displays the answer.

2) Simulate deploying the above application to a user's computer. If you're really ambitious and want to show off, after you get the simple one working, add client/server functionality to your Word Occurrences application.

Use the export feature in Eclipse to generate a runnable Jar file
In a command window, run the jar file using the syntax "java -jar <name>.jar"



### How to run the application on Windows (after downloading the repository)
1. Open Windows Command Prompt terminal
2. Navigate to where `Prime-Number-App.jar` is located
3. Enter the following into terminal:
java --module-path "<PATH_TO_FX/lib>" --add-modules=javafx.controls -jar Prime-Number-App.jar
